# This is the game!
# The game will create a file called Game_Files, if none already exists.
# It will then ask for login or to create an account.
# Once it has verified credentials VIA login or created account it will ask to start the game.
# Once game is started, the game will generate a random letter and ask the user for input of a word (String).
# It will then check if the string includes the letter of the attempt or not.
# It will then record the attempt with account, date and time, win or loss, generated letter, and guessed word.


# If Game_Files is not in "echo ls" (looking in current directory) touch Game_Files

# Ask user for username or password or if they would like to create an account

# If username and password provided then check login credentials from Game_Files.
#	If username and password match a record in Game_Files then display "Hello (user). press "s" to start the game!".
#       If username and password DO NOT match a record in Game_Files then display "Username or password don't exist or match.".

# If user opts to create credentials then ask for username and password and record those in Game_Files.
# Then echo those credentials to the login algorythm and login.

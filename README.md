# Welcome to my game!
this game prompts you to sign in or create a username and pasword that can be used for data collection and logging.

it then asks you if you would like to play or not (how polite).

then it prompts you to enter a word. Now, the more intelegent among you may realize that this program doesn't check the word against any dictionary, so you could judt enter all 26 letters, in any order, if you wanted. 

Either way, after you have entered your (hopefully valid) word, the game generates a random letter and checks if the word contains the letter.

if the word contains the letter, it informs you that you won and what the generated letter is.

if the word doesn't contain the letter, it informs you that you lost and what the generated letter is.

it then continues to prompt if you would like to play again until you say no. in which case, it thanks the player for playing, waits a courtesy two seconds for the message to sink in, and then closes.
